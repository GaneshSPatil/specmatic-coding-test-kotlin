Following feedback has been additionally incorporated from the previous Java Solution

1. <DONE> Implement the solution in Kotlin
2. <DONE> Use Composition over inheritance to represent Product has ProductDetails
3. <NOT IMPLEMENTED> Remove ResponseEntity as return type from Controller responses?
   This will lead to different return types in the controller
   As, get will return List<Product>
   And, post will return ResponseEntity<ID> as we need to return 201.

4. <DONE> Introduce service for Controller -> Service -> Repository communication
5. <DONE> Use single method to retrieve products providing optional ProductType filter.
6. <DONE> Tests for the TextOnlyValidator
7. <DONE> TextOnly should enforce null check.
